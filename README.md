# GOAWAY;TOUCHGRASS
**Overview:**
The news sucks and it makes everyone sad. This is a brutalist/anti-design news site to shock the user and maybe encourage them to go outside. 

###  Installation
- `fork` this repo and clone it to your local machine
- `cd` into the repo
- `npm install` dependencies
- `npm start` to be automatically redirected to the site

### API Key and .env file
This application runs off a NewsAPI key and you will need to enter your own for run this application locally.
- Create a `.env` file in your root directory
- Paste `REACT_APP_NEWS_KEY="your-api-key"` inot your .env and replace `your-api-key` with your API key
- Add your `.env` to your `.gitignore` file if you plan to push this this repo to GitHub
- Everything should work from there!
